# GenomicScribe-Machine-Learning-for-Gene-Function-Prediction
This project implements a machine learning pipeline for predicting gene functions from genomic data. The system processes DNA sequences, extracts relevant features, and applies various ML models to classify genes into functional categories based on the Gene Ontology (GO) framework.
